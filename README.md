## Description

After creating the [right angle connector](https://www.printables.com/model/725135) my youngest moved back home to go back to college to get a second degree.
That entailed adding two cats to our household.
I use the skadis pegboard as a simplistic enclosure around my 3D printer so that it's easy to mount tools where they are always handy.
I was concerned about the cats biting the cables around the printer, so I need to fully enclose my printer with skadis pegboard obviously.  :)

This project reuses the washer from the YARA project and adds a straight connector.
While these are readily available, I wanted to maintain the look and feel of the YARA connector so quickly made my own.

The washer for this model is sized to match a #17 hex socket to make tightening them very easy.  The hex nut fits VERY snugly in the washer, I use pliers to seat them, they aren't really press-to-fit, but I wanted them tight because I didn't want them to strip out the washer, and I didn't have square nuts, which would have been more suited for this application.

I put everything together reasonably loosely on the pegboard, and then position everything like I like and then tighten them up using the hex socket on a ratchet.  I love the way they turned out.

I put one set at the top and one set at the bottom.
